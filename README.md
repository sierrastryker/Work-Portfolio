# Sierra Stryker Portfolio

This portfolio highlights three example projects that cover a range of topics, including data visualization, data analytics, and an agent-based model. 

In this introduction, I will briefly describe each project and demonstrate their viability for application in the workplace. 

All files are Quarto markdowns (.qmd) written in R and designed in RStudio. Quarto builds off of base R and RMarkdown, but uses a more intutitve interface and allows for enhanced visual formatting.

## Data Visualization

`data_visualization.qmd`

The example file for data visualization includes various types of graphs for different types of data.

## Data Analytics

For data management and analyses, the example file (`data_analyses.qmd`) uses a modified version of the ___ dataset to run multiple types of analyses and present findings. All findings are written in APA formatting and are meant to clearly communicate the results to a broad audience. 

This file showcases my proficiency with filtering datasets as well as quickly and clearly renaming levels within a single variable.

## Agent-Based Model

An agent-based model (ABM) is a type of simulation wherein individuals are represented by a simple set of rules and their subsequent behaviors can be measured and analyzed. For example, a researcher could evaluate the likelihood of employee turnover by simulating an applicant's person-environment fit and person-job fit. By programming the applicant with a series of rules about what circumstances they would leave their organization and then simulating different types of organizations, an ABM can give key insight into how likely an applicant is to leave, how much turnover should be expected, and the effectiveness of organizational interventions. 

My example ABM replicates Scullen et al. (2005) which simulated the strategy of terminating the bottom 5% of the workforce on an annual basis. By doing so, organizations put more resources into hiring, but there was found to be a greater level of employee effectiveness over time. 

Within the model, agents are generatived with randomized scores for X, Y, and Z and then given a performance evaluation and either retained or terminated based on their performance report. Performance values were calculated based on X variable, but included an element of randomization representing potential inaccuracies or biases in evaluations.
